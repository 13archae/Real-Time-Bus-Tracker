# Real Time Bus Tracker #
### The project is intended to show in near-real-time where busses are along the route between Harvard and MIT in Boston.  I upgraded to include additional data in an InfoBox, which sits atop the icon for the bus. ###
### To run this small app, you must navigate to the html page via browser, or drag-n-drop the page onto your browser window.
### I will call a second url hosted by the same as the first, to add additional data about the stations.
