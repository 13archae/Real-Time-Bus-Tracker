## Boston Bus Tracker 
### Description
- Generate and launch pac-men to bounce around your browser.
- The pac-men stay within the bounds of the browser window, which is accomplished through a basic colision-detection system.
- This system uses the inner width and height of the browser window to define "walls" to "bounce" the pac-men around the width and height of the window.
- JavaScript is used to move the pac-men by continually updating their coordinates. 
### To run this small app, you must navigate to the html page via browser, or drag-n-drop the page onto your browser window.
### I will call a second url hosted by the same as the first, to add additional data about the stations.
